def infix_to_postfix(query_string):
    '''
    Converts a query string from infix to postfix notation

    We receive an infix string from the front-end, because it's easier to build
    However, postfix is easier to process, so that's how we save it

    Infix vs. postfix notation is just a matter of where the operate sits;
    In infix notation, the operator is between the operands:
        A + B
    In postfix notation, the operator comes after the operands:
        A B +

    We prefer postfix for two reasons:
        1. The expression is always unambiguous
            Consider 3 - 4 + 5.
            Without brackets, this is an ambiguous formula; it could be either:
                (3 - 4) + 5 == 4
                3 - (4 + 5) == -6
            In postfix, those two formula have different constructions:
                3 4 - 5 +
                3 4 5 + -
            We can save some characters (and some parsing issues) by using
            postfix notation

        2. Parsing a postfix string is easy
            As the algorithms here indicate, it's somewhat more difficult
            to parse an infix expression, because an operator token is read
            before all of its operands are known

            There's negligible performance gain in modern computers,
            especially on input sizes this small, but it makes the algorithms
            easier to understand
